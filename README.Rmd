This Github repository contains the data and code used in the article "Modulation of auditory peripersonal space by approaching and receding sources moving in discrete steps".

## The study

The region of the space in which we can interact with the outside world by touching, grasping and grabbing is usually known as the peripersonal space (PPS). In particular, when the object that we want to reach is located through audition, we can talk of the auditory peripersonal space. This extension of the PPS is known to be dynamic and to be affected by the environment, the inner state of the listener as well as characteristics of the auditory object, for example if the object is continuously moving towards or away from the listener. In this paper, we studied the auditory representation of the peripersonal space for sources that moved in discrete steps. In each trial, a sound source was presented to the listener at a given distance and they had to respond whether the sound source was within their arm's reach without performing the action. These reachability judgments involve the representation of the spatial location of the source and also of the potential actions the subject can perform, therefore are a good proxy to estimate the extension of the auditory PPS. In two conditions (simple staircases) the source moved from trial to trial one step closer or further to the subject, giving the impression through several consecutive presentations of a source approaching or receding. In the other two conditions, the trajectory of the source was not well defined across consecutive presentations. Our results indicate that reachability judgments are affected by the previous positions of the sound source. When the source approaches the listener, it is judged more reachable at the same real position than when it recedes, suggesting an expansion of the auditory peripersonal space for approaching sound and extending. When the source presents a non-defined trajectory (control condition) the reachability displays an intermediate value. These results are in line with previous research that showed similar effects for sound sources moving along continuous trajectories. The shift in the boundaries of the peripersonal space are interpreted in light of the recent proposals of the function of the peripersonal space as an interface to the possibilities of action of the subject against external events.

## The data
The folder data contains the data organized by experiment and experimental task and include a data.log file. In order to better explain how the data is organized we will give examples of how the code works.

## The code
The code can be find in the folder named... well... code.
