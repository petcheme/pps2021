### This document describes changes made to the data files, and some issues that need to be taken care of ###

S01
Dual staircase, block 1: Staircases have 11 reversals (instead of 12). Maybe the cause was an execution error, since one of the two staircases has responses beyond the 11th reversal (the stop rule in the mat file was set to 12).

Note: mat files are not included in the repo at the time of writing.

S53
There was one RT missing, and, due to the way the Matlab export code worked, the complete register was missing also. The export code was fixed and the register is now included in the corresponding csv file (with the RT coded as NA). This also led to update the code for detecting outliers, allowing it to handle missing data.

The register is: S53, dual, 1, near, 1, 31, 130, 0, 12, NA, FALSE, FALSE

Note: the Matlab export code is not included in the repo at the time of writing.

S61
Simple staircase, block 1 (near): The subject id stored in the mat file was incorrect (S62 instead of S61). The corresponding registers were corrected in the csv. Also, the Matlab export code was fixed in order to allow detection of this type of inconsistency in the data.

S63
Dual staircases, block 2: This block was carried out two times (files Results_S63_2_2001-01-03_01_46.mat and Results_S63_2_2001-01-03_01_57.mat). Presumably, there was some problem with the first instance, and this led to repeat the whole block. The second instance is now coded as block 3 in the csv.

To do: One of the two instances should be discarded and coded as **the** block 2. Perhaps should check the computer used to conduct the experiments. Also check both data before deciding which one will be discarded. Assuming that there was some problem with the first instance, the second one should be kept.

S65
Simple staircases: There are five blocks (instead of four). Same as with S63, presumably one block was interrupted and had to be repeated. Block 5 corresponds to simple-far.

To do: Check data and the experimental computer for some clues.

What follows is information recovered from the experiment's log.

S62
This subject performed a dual staircase at the beginning of the experiment (dual-far). The subject failed to display reversals within the experimental range, and therefore it was decided to perform the psychometric curve afterwards (instead of continuing with the dual staircases, as established in the experimental design), then the simple staircases and then finalize with the remaining dual staircase (dual-near). The subject was able to show a PSE for the psychometric curve, but continued to report being able to reach to sources located beyond the farther limit of the experimental range (the experimenter also tested distances beyond the range, with the same result).

This problem can be observed in the data, by plotting the source position as a function of the number of trial. For farther sources, it can be seen that the source is presented at the far end for several trials in a row. This happened because the experiment was programmed to maintain the source position within the physical limits of the setup.

To do: Remove subject's data.

S63
The second block of the dual staircases was performed twice due to problems with the speaker (a faulty connection provoked noise during stimulus playback). This was noted in the previous entry (date 2022-03-20).

To do: Discard the first instance of the block 2 of the dual staircases.

S65
In block 1 of simple staircases (far) the subject displayed reversals beyond the experimental range. This led to modify the presentation order for simple staircases (from far-far-near-near to far-near-near-far). The other problem with this subject was that block 4 of simple staircases had to be performed twice due to a problem with the speaker (faulty connection again).

To do: Replace block 4 of the simple staircases with the block 5.

S66
Dual staircase, block 1, trial 15, the stimulus did not sound correctly (due to the faulty cable already mentioned) and the subject was required to give a random response in order to continue the procedure (the procedure program did not allow to repeat the presentation). This response resulted in a reversal but it should not be taken into account for the calculation of the PSE. Note: the position of the source was 150 cm.

Here ends the information recovered from the experiment's log. There is something else to note:

S64
According to the experiment's log there was a S64. However the corresponding data is not present in the csv's (except for a measure of the arm's reach).

---

Final note: Data was corrected for S63 (dual staircase, block 3 replaced block 2), S65 (simple staircase, block 5 replaced block 4) and S66 (dual staircase, block 1, trial 15, wrongly coded as a reversal). Also S62 data was removed (moved to a new sub-folder: discarded). Remains to see what happened to S64.


2022-03-22
----------

S64: We recovered another version of the experiment's log, in which it is stated that this session could not be carried out due to a power outage.


2022-03-26

Summary of the recent changes applied to the data and related information:

S01: none
S53: the register with the missing RT was corrected
S61: the id was corrected
S62: data moved to a new folder: discarded
S63: dual staircase, block 3 replaced block 2
S64: the subject did not perform the experiment
S65: simple staircase, block 5 replaced block 4

Also, outliers were recalculated after the changes in S63 (dual-near) and S65 (simple-far).
